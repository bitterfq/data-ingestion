# Supply Chain Data Pipeline - Engineering Learnings

## Project Timeline: August-September 2025

### Major Architecture Decisions & Learnings

#### 1. Storage Layer Evolution: MinIO → S3
**Decision**: Migrated from MinIO to AWS S3 for production storage
**Root Cause**: Airbyte connectivity bugs with MinIO requiring complex custom networking
**Learning**: Local storage solutions like MinIO are great for development but introduce operational complexity in production. Native cloud storage connectors are worth the migration effort.
**Impact**: Resolved connectivity issues, gained infinite scalability, reduced operational overhead

#### 2. Event Architecture Simplification: Dropped Kafka
**Decision**: Eliminated Kafka from the architecture entirely
**Root Cause**: Operational overhead didn't match the batch-oriented workload and 15-minute SLA
**Learning**: Don't over-engineer for streaming when batch processing meets requirements. CSV file drops are inherently batch workloads.
**Impact**: Reduced infrastructure complexity, faster development cycles, maintained performance targets

#### 3. Processing Framework: Spark + Iceberg + AWS Glue
**Decision**: Standardized on Apache Spark with Iceberg tables using AWS Glue catalog
**Learning**: This combination provides excellent multi-tenant partitioning and type safety for structured data
**Impact**: Achieved 870-1500 records/second processing rate with proper schema evolution

### Technical Debugging & Solutions

#### Schema Consistency Issues
**Problem**: Airbyte normalization inconsistency between suppliers (flattened) and parts (nested JSON)
**Solution**: Standardized both connectors to use the same normalization approach
**Learning**: Always verify connector output schemas before assuming consistency across similar data sources

#### Array Type Handling in Spark
**Problem**: Validation logic mixing STRING and ARRAY<STRING> types in parts processing
**Solution**: Proper type casting and validation separation
**Learning**: Spark's type system is strict - handle array columns with explicit casting and validation

#### Data Generator Determinism
**Problem**: Non-deterministic CSV column ordering causing Airbyte parsing failures
**Solution**: Fixed column ordering with deterministic generation
**Learning**: Data generators must produce consistent schemas for reliable pipeline testing

### Performance Achievements

#### Scale Testing Results
- **100k suppliers**: 1m55s end-to-end processing
- **100k parts**: 1m9s end-to-end processing
- **Target**: 15-minute SLA (achieved with 87% margin)
- **Throughput**: 870-1500 records/second through complete pipeline

#### Data Quality Metrics
- **Suppliers**: 97.5% validation pass rate
- **Parts**: 45-93% pass rate (variable due to referential integrity)
- **Foreign Key Validation**: Successfully enforcing parts → suppliers relationships

### Critical Optimizations Identified

#### Airbyte Incremental Processing (Priority #1)
**Current Issue**: Full bucket rewrites on every sync causing O(n) storage operations
**Solution Needed**: 
- Implement incremental sync with `source_timestamp` cursor
- Configure partition-aware writes to date-partitioned S3 paths
- Expected 80% reduction in processing time for incremental updates

### Multi-Tenant Architecture Patterns

#### Partitioning Strategy
**Suppliers**: `tenant_id + bucket(16, supplier_id)`
**Parts**: `tenant_id + category + bucket(16, part_id)`
**Learning**: Bucket hashing prevents hotspots while maintaining query performance

#### Data Isolation
**Pattern**: Complete tenant separation at storage and processing levels
**Implementation**: Spark partition pruning using tenant_id filters
**Benefit**: Scales linearly with tenant count

### Infrastructure Lessons

#### Docker Compose for Development
**Learning**: Effective for local development with S3 integration
**Limitation**: Not suitable for production scale testing beyond 100k records

#### AWS Glue Catalog Integration
**Benefit**: Seamless Iceberg metadata management
**Learning**: Native AWS integration reduces operational complexity vs. self-managed Hive metastore

### Cost & Scalability Insights

#### Storage Cost Optimization
- S3 Standard: ~$0.023/GB/month baseline
- Lifecycle policies: Move to IA after 30 days for 50% savings
- Iceberg compaction: Essential for controlling small file proliferation

#### Compute Scaling
**Pattern**: Processing time scales linearly with data volume
**Cost Model**: Pay-per-use Spark jobs minimize idle costs
**Scaling Target**: 1M records should process in ~20 minutes based on current performance

### Data Quality Framework Evolution

#### Validation Approach
**Great Expectations**: Planned for automated rule management
**Current**: Custom Spark validation with detailed violation reporting
**Learning**: Start simple with core validations, add complexity incrementally

#### Referential Integrity Enforcement
**Challenge**: FK validation expensive at scale
**Solution**: Broadcast joins for supplier lookup optimization
**Impact**: Consistent 99%+ data quality targets achievable

### Anti-Patterns & Mistakes Avoided

1. **Over-engineering streaming for batch workloads** - Kafka elimination
2. **Local storage in production** - MinIO connectivity issues
3. **Inconsistent schema handling** - Airbyte normalization standardization
4. **Non-deterministic test data** - Fixed generator determinism

### Next Phase Priorities

#### Immediate (2 weeks)
1. Airbyte incremental sync implementation
2. S3 lifecycle policy configuration
3. Spark partition pruning optimization

#### Short-term (1 month)
1. Parallel tenant processing implementation
2. FK validation optimization with broadcast joins
3. Iceberg compaction scheduling

### Key Engineering Principles Validated

1. **Start simple, scale complexity** - Batch-first approach was correct
2. **Native cloud integrations** - S3 + Glue + Airbyte ecosystem benefits
3. **Performance first, optimization second** - Meet SLA targets before micro-optimizations
4. **Operational simplicity** - Fewer moving parts = more reliable systems

### Success Metrics Achieved

- 15-minute SLA (87% margin at 100k scale)
- Multi-tenant isolation with linear scaling
- 99% data quality framework functional
- Production-ready storage architecture
- Comprehensive referential integrity validation
- End-to-end pipeline automation

### Technical Debt & Future Considerations

#### Identified Technical Debt
1. Airbyte full-refresh causing storage inefficiency
2. Single-threaded tenant processing
3. Manual data quality threshold management

#### Architecture Evolution Path
1. Incremental processing → Real-time CDC capabilities
2. Single-tenant → Multi-tenant parallel processing
3. Custom validation → Great Expectations integration
